        <h2>"Economic Resilience Through the Decades: A Tale of GDP Growth"</h2>
        <p>
            2000:
            Entering the new millennium, the GDP growth rate slightly dipped to 7%. The burst of the dot-com bubble and the economic repercussions of the 9/11 attacks led to some economic uncertainty, but the world quickly adapted to new challenges and opportunities in the digital age.
            2010:
            In the 2010s, the graph shows a steady recovery, with GDP growth stabilizing at 4%. But governments and central banks implemented various measures to stimulate economic growth, resulting in a gradual return to stability.
            2020:
            The year 2020 stands out on the graph due to a sudden and sharp drop in GDP growth The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the global economy, business closures, and widespread job losses. Governments implemented massive stimulus packages to mitigate the damage, but the effects of the pandemic were significant.
            2023:
            As we reach 2023, the graph shows signs of recovery, with GDP growth gradually rebounding to 5%. The global economy has adapted to the new normal, and the lessons learned from the pandemic have spurred investments in healthcare, technology, and sustainable industries.
            This is the economic journey from 2000 to 2023.</p>
