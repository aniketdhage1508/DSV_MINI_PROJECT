        <h2>Population Vs GDP Per Capita</h2>
        <p>Early Years (Left Side of the Graph):
            At the beginning of the time period, we see relatively low population growth but also low GDP per capita. This suggests that the country might have been in an early stage of development, with limited resources and a small labor force.
            
            Transition Phase (Middle of the Graph):
            As we move towards the middle of the graph, we notice an upward trend in population growth. This might be due to improvements in healthcare, increased birth rates, and possibly an influx of immigrants seeking economic opportunities. Simultaneously, GDP per capita starts to rise, indicating economic growth driven by a larger labor force and potentially increased productivity.
            
            High Population Growth (Right Side of the Graph):
            In the later years of the study period, the population growth continues to rise, reaching its peak. This could be attributed to a "youth bulge" or other demographic factors. Interestingly, despite the high population growth, the GDP per capita does not increase at the same rate. This could be due to challenges in creating enough jobs, providing adequate infrastructure, and ensuring equitable wealth distribution for the growing population.</p>
